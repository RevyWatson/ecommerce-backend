For this application I was provided starter code and tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site. This application utizes Express.js API in tandem with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Acceptance Criteria
* When the user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
* When the user enters the schema and seed commands the development database is created and is seeded with test data
* When the user enters the command to invoke the application their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
* When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## Dependencies

This application utizes the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect the Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository.  
2. Open the command terminal on your machine.
2. Navigate through your file system to the location of the cloned repo inside the Develope folder.
3. To install the dependencies type “npm i”.
4. Open the dotenv file and add your local instance name and password like so:
```
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
DB_USER='your local instance's name here'
DB_PW='your mySQL Workbench password here'
```
5. Open the schema.sql file in mySQL Workbench and run the file to create the database.
6. Return to the command line terminal and type, "npm run seed" to seed the database. Open mySQL Workbench to check that the database tables have been seeded.
7. Return to the command line terminal and type, "npm start" to activate the server.
8. Once the server is "listening" you can open Insomnia Core to manipulate and view the the data using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
